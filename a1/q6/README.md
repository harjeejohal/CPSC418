This is my solution to question 6 of CPSC 418 assignment 1. The following files are relevant to the problem:

modifyFile.py - This file decrypts a ciphertext file passed in, replaces the substring CODE-RED with CODE-BLUE if it exists in the decrypted plaintext, and then writes this plaintext to a new file. After successfully decrypting the file, it also outputs the password that Bob used as his key in the original encryption process. It takes in one command-line arugment - the name of the ciphertext file to be read.

encrypteFile.py - This file encrypts the "tampered" plaintext that is decrypted by modifyFile.py. It follows all of the same steps as Bob's hash-then-encrypt protocol. It takes in three command-line arguments: the plaintext-filename, which contains the tampered plaintext generated in modifyFile.py, the tampered-filename, which is the name of the output file that the ciphertext generated by encryptFile.py is written to, and password, which is the password used as a key by Bob in his hash-then-encrypt protocol.
